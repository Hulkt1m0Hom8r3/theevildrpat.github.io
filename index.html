        <p>
          On a mission from a distant galaxy, Zeta is here to study the races and customs of this world. Until he learns, he may commit the occasional social faux pas, and is sometimes a little too curious.  While very fragile, he is able to use his mind in astonishing ways.  To protect himself from danger, to communicate, and to hold beings in suspension.  He comes equipped with a probe, which lets him learn about creatures, a golden record he found that can be thrown like a Frisbee, a plasma pistol and some strange tools.

        <p>
          Hector comes from noble blood but was disowned from his family for taking very long and masturbatory showers too frequently. His family didn’t even give him a chance to get through puberty before he was thrown out to be raised by the wolves, where he was accepted as one of their own due to the natural lack of showers required by wolves. Hector’s wolf family scrimped and saved to put him through school where he graduated magna cum laude with a degree in ‘Long range, chain-based weapons’ from College of Dupage.

        <p>
          Dispatched from the Underdark to do missionary work in the World Above. Converted by druids who encouraged him away from cruelty and towards nature worship. Learned healing, animal summoning and to live in unity with the natural world, but occasionally slips back into hedonism and sadism when provoked.

          DVB comes from an ordinary family in a bustling city where it was easy to remain anonymous. This anonymity allowed him to lead a life of mischief and crime until early adulthood when his life-long friend was brutally murdered in a botched robbery at the corner candy shop. Haunted by his past, he found solace in music with the help of alcohol and ultimateguitartabs.com. He decided to leave his family and set off on a journey to introduce the power of sound to all he encounters.

        <p>
          Super tall, black stripes and a long tail with pointy ears and a half human half dog face; kinda like Kylo Ren. Has some magic ability to cast healing spells, all attacks come from the animal that is currently tamed. Basically a good version of Tom Riddle, as a kid he could talk to snakes. "spirit, drive and determination to rise to the challenge."

        <p>
          Rumors swirl that Dogmeat was banished from his home nation, for reasons unknown as of now.  He lived alone in the forests and mountains on the frontier before meeting up with the party.  He appears and can pass as a human, but was raised by a forest tribe of dryads before being exiled.
