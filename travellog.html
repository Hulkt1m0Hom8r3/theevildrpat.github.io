            So far you guys have started a building on fire which killed several
            people, actively killed a soon-to-be grandfather gnome, looted the
            bar you started on fire, looted both the living and dead gnome (also
            tried to dismember and keep a cooked dead gnome), and tried to break
            in to the residence above the bar.

            The group visits Totally Tonics and picks up some supplies. Randy
            tries to revisit the witch, but with no luck. The group visits the
            candy shop only to realize it is now a weapons shop. We find a group
            of monster elvish children locked in the basement who were given
            nightglow for bathing purposes, slayed the children then the store
            manager (store owned by Don Crustbluff). We then go to a river to
            wash up and to the armor store, where nobody is hurt or killed. We
            venture out into the woods and find the man-eating bear after luring
            him with some intentionally burnt wolf steaks. Bear is easily slain,
            and the druid darts off into the woods. Party pockets bear balls.

            Somehow 9 months have passed and everyone wakes to a burned up ash
            pile and long beards. Green Na’vi and Small Grey dude joins the
            group. Hector checks his stomach to see if he is still pregnant but
            his child is gone. There is a “C” mark on his stomach. Then the
            group encounters a farmer who offers them information in exchange
            for passing three riddles. The group succeeds with flying colors and
            the farmer hands over 3 pieces of parchment. The group decides to
            kill him anyways but they fail and instead shit their pants, and
            cover the parchment in shit in the process. Then we covered it in
            more shit. We read two notes, then proceeded north to the mountains
            (leaving behind a note for Dogmeat) when we came across a barn with
            oinking coming from inside, it’s pig fuckers.We battle into the
            night….
